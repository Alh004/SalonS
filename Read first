Customer Portal: Create, edit, and delete personal bookings

Admin Portal: View all bookings and customer data, perform administrative actions

Razor Pages UI: Fast, page-based structure using Pages and backing PageModels

Repositories:

IKundeRepository and IBookingRepository are injected as services

PageModels use methods like FindKundeAsync, CreateBookingAsync, UpdateBookingAsync, etc.

Technology and Architecture
ASP.NET Core Razor Pages

Enabled via: builder.Services.AddRazorPages()

Mapped with: app.MapRazorPages()

Dependency Injection

Repositories registered as singletons:

csharp
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IKundeRepository>(new KundeRepository(true));
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IBookingRepository>(new BookingRepository(true));
Easy to replace with a real database later
